# My visit to FOSDEM26

## Introduction
FOSDEM (Free and Open-Source Software Developers' European Meeting) is an annual conference that happens on the first weekend of February and is hosted by the Free University of Brussels in its Solbosch campus. It gathers more than 8000 engineers and includes a very broad programme, revised each year, of keynote speeches, main track and thematical ("developer room") talks, flash talk (15 min.) reports, Bird-of-Feather "non-programmed" panels and project stands where you can listen to and speak with the leading people of the biggest open-source projects in the world as well as very small promising projects.

## Saturday
My day started with a traditional FOSDEM t-shirt and tour of [stands](https://fosdem.org/2026/stands/) in the K building. I sneaky-peeked at many projects, led by curiosity to seem what's new with them. One worth noting is [Gitlab Contributors](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/) stand where I had a chance to ask [Raimond Hook](https://gitlab.com/stingrayza) some questions about a tool I have been developing for our internal u-blox needs and am having a specific problem with.

Around 9:50, I went to one of the main track locations where I spent most of the day. The first talk was by [Michiel Leenaars](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/michiel_leenaars/) about [current state and near future of FOSS](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/FE7ULY-foss-in-times-of-war-scarcity-and-ai/) in the context of technology and politics that drives and applies its development. The central point of the talk was brought up in the first minutes and stood out throughout it: `FOSS` has to preserve `F` in it, i.e., it was created with freedom in mind. Modern combination of business trend, politics and technology make that task difficult. The speaker gave various examples which found understanding in the audience, such as widespread reliance on big Cloud providers, the trap of venture capital model for startups and danger of reckless LLM usage. The talk called for a wake-up in FOSS community, rethinking of financing the open-source projects and seeking its independence from geopolitics, hungry business and false assumptions in technology. That motif was "in the air" during both two days at the conference, being repeated in several other keynotes and smaller talks.

Next was a [talk](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/HTJK33-evolving_git_for_the_next_decade/) by libgit2 maintainer [Patrick Steinhardt](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/patrick_steinhardt/) on the biggest TODOs for git as a version control system. He reasoned that the fact that git "just works" doesn't mean its development should wane, by showing how the context it is used in has changed since 2005:
- giant monorepos that make Linux kernel look tiny;
- broken SHA-1;
- large binary files;
- heavy usage of CI; and of course
- usability issues.

All that has prompted improvement effort not only inside the git project, but also spawned some tools that can use git as a backend, like [Jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction). Taking that latter as an example that got several Git issues fixed, Patrick went through those UX fixes and reasoned what Git developers can learn from them. And when UX and other fixes (i.e., with large files) have appeared or are expected in git. Features like [large object promisors](https://git-scm.com/docs/large-object-promisors), [pluggable object db](https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq7buo8076.fsf@gitster.g/#:~:text=pluggable,database) and [git-history(1)](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250819-b4-pks-history-builtin-v1-0-9b77c32688fe@pks.im/) are already starting to emerge in the latest versions of git.

After that, I had a brief detour before continuing with the devops topic: I went to another part of the campus to listen to the talk "[An Endpoint Telemetry Blueprint for Security Teams](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/HYXTPH-endpoint-telemetry-blueprint/)" where [Victor Lyuboslavsky](https://github.com/getvictor) from [FleetDM](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) presented a scalable "pipeline" that can be used to monitor hundreds of thousands of multi-OS devices. Each stage in that "pipeline" (endpoint querying, fleet control, transport and storage, threat detection, representation and response) is implemented by one or more open-source package with sometimes more than one option for a stage. Such a blueprint solves well known problems of transparency, bandwidth restrictions, reliability, load balancing, automated detection and response measures etc. and can be used by security teams of small and big companies alike.

I returned back to the main track to the topic of collaborative code development: there were two interesting talks which complemented one another. The [first](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/3VNNBK-efficient-git-for-high-stakes/) focused on managing the history of your project, while the [second](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/L7ERNP-prs-maintainers-will-love/) regarded making changes to it in more detail.

Author of the first talk (see the slides and transcript [here](https://slides.com/gerold103/fosdem-2026-efficient-git)) shared his experience of applying so-called _Atomic Flow_ in git-based development where the key concepts are 
- commit "atomicity": each commit is the smallest indivisible change that has a clear reason ("_why?_" answered in its message), a test and does not break integration pipeline. In big changes (merge/pull requests or patchset in a mailing list), there is a clear structure where such self-contained commits are clearly segregated into _preparatory_ (refactoring, restructuring, internal API) and _functional_ sets;
- linear history: instead of fork-merge cycles, every patchset is always rebased on top of the main branch. Only fast-forwards are accepted, and merge commits are not tolerated.

This approach has proven to significantly speed development up by saving time on reviewing changes and conflict resolution (1,5..5 times, according to teams' testimonies), providing for traceability, easing investigations (`git-bisect` became actually usable). The approach does come with a cost, though: on average, engineers the author questioned had spent about 10% of their development time on it.

The second talk (slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rpq4OsOTpt8nQx_QzBuMzICCenUpeyCzsk4sc-gVpyA/edit?usp=sharing)) focused on one aspect of collaborative development: preparing and reviewing changes. The author, a community manager at [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip), shared experience of her company in embracing support from FOSS community via contributions. The approach they have taken over the years is to have a set of rules and best practices every PR should follow in order to be merged. That set saves a lot of time for both reviewers and contributors. They've compiled a comprehensive (but easy to read) [guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html) for new-comers. One of the biggest challenges in 2025 (as many other speakers at the conference have noted) has been AI slop. To cope with it, the project introduced "[AI use policy](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html#ai-use-policy-and-guidelines)" which every PR must comply with in order to even be considered by a human reviewer.

That completed my day at the main track but not the day at the conference. I went to the RISC-V devroom to [listen](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DL89YW-how-secure-are-commercial-risc-v-cpus/) to [Fabian](https://fabianthomas.de/) and [Lukas](https://lukasgerlach.me/), two researchers from [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en/research/groups/schwarz), who presented numerous flaws in commercial RISC-V processors' ISA extension implementations, demonstrating some of the exploits live. They also described an automated method to discover such flaws: "fuzzing" a CPU with programs; as well as [software](https://github.com/cispa/RISCover) that can help you do that. To improve design of a new product (before it's shipped as ASIC in milions of pieces), they gave numerous recommendations, which resulted in immediate feedback from special interest groups present in the audience to further discuss those improvements. See their slides [here](https://fosdem.org/2026/events/attachments/DL89YW-how-secure-are-commercial-risc-v-cpus/slides/267061/how-secur_k8wbask.pdf).

After that I listened to two more talks:
- [The Invisible Payload: A Generic Zero-Copy Architecture](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/A7BV7Y-generic-zero-copy-proxy-architecture/), which title was changed a bit in the last moment. It presented a solution in a specific field that is an application of a nice generic idea: when you have a big volume of scattered data, deal it out as meta-data and save on `memcpy()`;
- [Review of kernel and user-space Neural Processing Unit (NPU) chips support on Linux](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/QGKD3P-review_of_kernel_and_user-space_neural_processing_unit_npu_chips_support_on_linu/) which gave an overview of software support for commercial boards for training and inference tasks.

After all those talks, I met my friends and colleagues and we went to search for a bar to sit down and discuss the day. As we were passing by one of them, [someone](https://luma.com/xz5h03lo) called out asking if we were from FOSDEM and whether we knew what [GitButler](https://gitbutler.com/) was. Next moment, we found ourselves inside with green wristbands that gave us unlimited beer, surrounded by similar-looking groups of happy programmers :-)

## Sunday
My day started in the Distributions devroom with Lennart Poettering advocating for [Varlink IPC and its implementation in systemd](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/NFNKEK-varlink-ipc-system-keynote/). He gave a nice overview of problems that [Varlink](https://varlink.org/) aims to solve (I think still following the [original idea](https://harald.hoyer.xyz/2017/12/18/varlink/)) and its [current status](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/NEWS#:~:text=Varlink) in systemd. The talk was filled with sense and humor, which I liked. Lennart is now not working for MS, which also a good thing. Although his new company [Amutable](https://amutable.com/blog/introducing-amutable) seems to continue and focus on the same stuff he _was_ doing at MS, which is an _alarming_ thing.

I then went to the SBOM devrom to get an idea what a [CRA-ready SBOM generation](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/UYTGWA-sbom-generation/) would take in practice as [Viktor Petersson](https://vpetersson.com/) shared his experience working with tons of them. The main idea I got from it is that CRA compliance asks not for perfection but for _showing best effort_ to mitigate vulnerabilities and respond to incidents. Therefore, the approach to generate SBOM is guided primarily by practice: its application for tracking dependencies, feasibility at the company, etc. The presenter shared a flow (with each step provided by a set of tools) that could be used by FOSS projects and companies (product manufacturers) when they want to be compliant.

As the previous year, this year the [Embedded, Mobile and Automotive](https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2025q4/003654.html) devroom had 10- and 25-minute [talks](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/embedded-mobile-and-automotive/), organized systematically. I like that as the material gets presented compressed and to the point.

The first talk that I listened to was [Tamper-resistant factory data from the bootloader](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/97DP7F-tamper-resistant_factory_data_from_the_bootloader/), presenting a way to securely personalize devices running [Barebox](https://www.barebox.org/) bootloader with signed key-value pairs that become part of the trust chain and are available early during boot. Data is safe from replay attacks by binding to some already authenticated unique SoC data, e.g., unique ID or a link layer address. It can be passed on further along the boot chain, e.g., to Linux kernel.

Then [Thomas Petazzoni](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/thomas_petazzoni/) presented [Snagboot](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/7BBMJ3-snagboot_vendor-agnostic_open-source_and_developer-friendly_recovery_and_reflash/): a tool to return failing SoC devices back to life (safe-boot, reflash) in a unified vendor-agnostic manner. It is written in Python and does not depend on any vendor software. It already supports many TI, NXP, Microchip, ST, Broadcom, Amlogic and Xilinx SoCs.

After that, a [lightweight CVE analysis tool](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/P3AZ7U-sbom-cve-check-analysis-tool-for-embedded-systems/) was presented that can serve as a drop-in replacement to Yocto-only "cve-check". The tool does not depend on the build system in use. It accepts SBOM in SPDX 2.2 or 3.0 (CycloneDX support is planned), or a Yocto-generated JSON VEX manifest. It then checks the data against [NVD](https://github.com/fkie-cad/nvd-json-data-feeds) or [CVE List](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5) databases and generates vulnerability assessments in one of the popular formats: (Yocto's) cve-check JSON summary, CSV or SPDX 3.0. The tool has several [important features](https://github.com/bootlin/sbom-cve-check?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap) planned and is actively developed.

I ran back to the SBOM devroom to listen about [the Zephyr RTOS Case](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ZXJD8E-sboms_for_embedded_firmware_the_zephyr_rtos_case_study/): how SBOM generation is integrated into the project's build system and what you can do once you've generated a bunch of SBOM files. In particular, I was interested in what SPDX 3.0 format gives you in practice. The speaker demonstrated vizualisation of dependencies of a simple Zephyr application on exact versions of its libraries and other packages in a device as a navigable graph where you could see all files included in them and their build time configuration. I believe that is only the surface: the new graph-oriented format may give you much more info, which is mmm... exciting.

The next talk was remarkable. Not only because of its provocative title "[Forget SBOMs, use PURLs](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DRGX73-purl/)" but mainly because it was given by two people originally behind the two most popular SBOM formats: SPDX - [Philippe Ombredanne](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/philippe_ombredanne/); and CycloneDX - [Steve Springett](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/steve_springett/). Of course, it was not meant to discourage using SBOMs but instead to promote adoption of [package URLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) as a means to precisely identify packages in those SBOMs. The problem here is that for the same package, two or more distinct SBOM files may be generated with different contents (and/or using the other format). That would make them very difficult to match, compare and reason about in supply chain analysis. PURL aims to solve the problem by precisely identifying a package, regardless of its build environment or where it came from. The idea quickly has become an [ECMA standard](https://tc54.org/purl/) and was added to the standard [CVE record format](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/releases/tag/v5.2.0). One interesting side note in the talk for me was mentioning of [ESSTRA](https://github.com/sony/esstra) - a Sony initiative to "embed" software metadata into toolchains (starting with GCC) to help cover the "grey area" of your C/C++ project(s) and make SBOM metadata generation seamless, automatic and... a by-default step for any compiled software. See slides from the last year's DebConf talk about it [here](https://salsa.debian.org/henrich/debconf25/-/blob/main/20250718_DebConf25_ESSTRA.pdf).

I returned to the main track and, because I had some time before the next talk, sat down to listen to final part of the preceding one - [Implementing the Cyber Resilience Act - engaging with open source](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/EERURR-implementing_the_cyber_resilience_act_-_engaging_with_open_source/), - and was thankful. That was a talk by policy officers from various European agencies who have been involved in CRA development and enaction, including [one](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/carl-daniel_hailfinger/) from the German market surveillance authority (BSI) charged with overlooking the CRA compliance on the EU market. An important message that talk left in my memory (I _did_ actually watch the rest of it afterwards for more info) was that CRA puts virtually no obligation on a FOSS maintainer. Instead, it relieves them from accountability, shifting it to product manufacturers that use their software for commercial purposes. For instance, the law requires manufacturers to submit bugfixes back to the FOSS project in case of a discovered and fixed vulnerability. See some other typical FOSS - manufacturer cases [here](https://fosdem.org/2026/events/attachments/EERURR-implementing_the_cyber_resilience_act_-_engaging_with_open_source/slides/267519/helpful_r_85ur2mq.pdf).

The next talk, titled "[The Geopolitics of Code: From Digital Sovereignty to Global Fragmentation](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/XWSW3R-the_geopolitics_of_open_source_software/)", was by two software development analysts about prevailing trends of the FOSS as a contemporary phenomenon. It characterized the software and its development, outlined important problems and tried to reason about possible solutions. FOSS has become literally _fundamental_ for all electronic devices, networks and systems (including national security, defense and critical infrastructure) while being sovereign (i.e., truly _free_ and _open_). That quality has made it so popular and ensured fast technological advancement. Yet, over the years that quality has not been supported and safeguarded. On the contrary, it has been under constant threat, and the trend continues:
- maintainership of small but critical libraries / packages / components dwindles due to under-resourcing and / or increased pressure;
- national authorities "weaponize" projects by imposing restrictive measures (e.g., Linux kernel [maintainership cleansing](https://lwn.net/Articles/995186/)), employing "choke points" (e.g., Github [restrictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05489)) and even actively introducing backdoors (e.g., the [Linux kernel incident](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2013/10/09/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/) or quite recent [xz-utils one](https://jfrog.com/blog/xz-backdoor-attack-cve-2024-3094-all-you-need-to-know/)) and thereby cripple quality, security and reliability, _eroding the very foundation_ of systems they use;
- as a defensive measure, the global community becomes fragmented, isolated in "macro-regions", to the common loss rather than benefit.

In that regard, the main question arises: can FOSS survive as a worldwide community? The speakers propose a set of measures to answer that affirmatively. To me personally, those measures seem hard to implement in practice. On a positive note, they give a few examples of such measures already working. For instance, as I've learned from the previous talk, CRA regulation is made FOSS-friendly on purpose, to foster development and not interfere.

After the talk, I sprinted to the Embededd devroom to watch [Marta Rybczynska](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/marta_rybczynska/) give an [update on important things](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/KPCRXF-the-year-of-embedded-security/) in embedded security in the past year. While you can find full update in the [slides](https://fosdem.org/2026/events/attachments/KPCRXF-the-year-of-embedded-security/slides/267620/fosdem202_n40helx.pdf), here is what I noted to myself:
- CRA
    - vulnerability reporting becomes mandatory already in September 2026;
    - the [European vulnerability database](https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/) has been set up, but reporting functionality is not ready yet;
    - European Commission has set up a [FAQ for manufacturers](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act-implementation-frequently-asked-questions)
        - I.a., it clarifies that the "support period" (of obligations laid out in CRA) starts from the _date of selling_ a product (invoice date) and not, e.g., official launch on the market;
    - manufacturers have started to exhibit:
        - on one hand, increased awareness (compliance plan, supplying of SBOM);
        - on the other, misinformation (false CRA compliance claims, "selling" some extra features as mandatory);
    - for a manufacturer, it is high time to have CRA compliance plan, in particular vulnerability management process, _ready this year_!
- impact of quantum computing on cryptography
    - expected to start breaking "protected" data in 10-15 years
        - important to consider when the lifetime of devices is comparable;
    - primarily, ellyptic cryptography algorithms should be affected, symmetric encryption is still considered safe;
    - post-quantum alternatives are already implemented in many libraries
        - OpenSSL [has them](https://openssl.foundation/news/the-features-of-3-5-post-quantum-cryptography) since v3.5 (April 2025) and [some more](https://openssl-library.org/post/2025-10-01-3.6-release-announcement/) since v3.6 (October 2025);
- tools, toolchains and languages
    - `-fhardened` ["umbrella" option](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-15.2.0/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html) in gcc has been enhanced in its v15.1;
    - there has been a tendency to increase usage of memory-safe languages, e.g., Rust [stays in Linux](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Rust-To-Stay-Linux-Kernel);
    - use of AI has become abundant on both sides of the "front";
    - SBOM has become a normal release artifact, with increased standardization of format and process
        - however, there are still many unsolved problems like source patching, branching, "borrowed" code, identifying firmware blobs, etc.
- there has been increased attention on the bootloader and hypervisor level security
- notable vulnerabilities discovered
    - Busybox wget accepted symbols in a URL that could lead to abusive headers being injected into a request, [CVE-2025-60876](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-60876);
    - yet another `sudo` privilege escalation through a user-controlled `/etc/nsswitch.conf` in a chroot environment, [CVE-2025-32463](https://github.com/kh4sh3i/CVE-2025-32463);
    - `git checkout` of a submodule could lead to execution of attacker code on the behalf of user via a post-checkout hook, [CVE-2025-48384](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2025-48384). Submodules are evil `:-]`, don't use them.

The final talk of the day for me was on the main track by [Daniel Stenberg](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/daniel_stenberg/), maintainer of curl. We felt lucky to be inside because the big auditorium was completely full. The talk "[Open Source Security in spite of AI](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/B7YKQ7-oss-in-spite-of-ai/)" was on the hot topic of AI slop and its impact on the work of humans, especially when the SW project in question is at the heart of so many devices. In a humorous manner, Daniel shared experience of the [curl project](https://curl.se/) throughout last year, drawing some conclusions and warning the community to be critical towards the technology: instead of blind trust, treat it like a tool of limited precision. Perhaps his talk could be summarised as:
- this technology acts as an amplifier: for stupidity / incompetence or for talent / professionalism;
- (Daniel's phrase) AI will improve, <...> humans will certainly not improve.

The [closing talk](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/XN9DAW-closing_fosdem_2026/) had some statistics (as always), announcements (about going IPv6-only, _finally_) and the message that had been characteristic in many talks of the conference this time: "If we lose our democracies, Open Source is irrelevant and goes away".

## Conclusion
Past year has seen massive influence of technology and politics on FOSS. It has prompted pondering and adaptive response in the community, which is a good sign to observe.

As has been almost always with my trips to the conference, I have not been able to listen to all the talks I wanted to. Luckily, you can watch them afterwards, as all the [993 talks](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/events/) have been live-streamed and [saved](https://video.fosdem.org/2026/) for later reference (see [this talk](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/videobox/) for an answer to an engineer's instant "how?" question).
