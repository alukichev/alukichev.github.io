# My visit to FOSDEM20

## Introduction
FOSDEM (Free and Open-Source Software Developers' European Meeting) is an annual conference that happens on the first weekend of February and is hosted by the Free University of Brussels in its Solbosch campus. It gathers more than 8000 engineers and includes a very broad programme, revised each year, of keynote speeches, main track and thematical ("developer room") talks, flash talk (15 min.) reports and project stands, where you can listen to and speak with the leading people of the biggest open-source projects in the world as well as very small promising projects. This FOSDEM edition was 20th, and a feeling of celebration was present about it for all the 2 days (and no doubt on Friday night as well, when they hold a traditional beer event, which I avoid because of it being too crowdy).

## Saturday
My day started with a tour of [stands](https://fosdem.org/2020/stands/) in the K building, with some cool t-shirts and an update on the status of "heard-of" projects as takeaways. As the first floor was too crowded this time, I went straight to the second one, to find out what's new in [\[matrix\]](https://matrix.org/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [Opentap](https://www.opentap.io/) and other projects.

I had to interrupt my stand tour, because at 9:30 there was a [talk](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/linux_kernel/) in another building (on the opposite side of the campus) by [Thornsten Leemhuis](https://www.leemhuis.info/) about history of Linux kernel, reflections on how it got where it is now and where and how it's going to go in the near future. So I raced there and was not disappointed. As the speaker is a professional journalist, his talk _was_ very interesting.

After that I continued my interrupted tour of stands, first finishing with K and then traversing corridors of [H and AW buildings](https://nav.fosdem.org/). Among things to mention about it were demos of [Plasma UI for mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/roadmap/) phones by [KDE project](https://kde.org/) and embedded devices running Javascript (!) (e.g., [this](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js) smart watch) and [micropython](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/) (e.g., [this](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/pyboard/quickref.html) board).

After going back to my place (relatively close to campus) for lunch and returning back, I listened to Moisés Guimarães [talking](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/security_protecting_plaintext_secrets_in_configuration_files/) about an [OSLO](https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/oslo.html)-based alternative to Python's standard [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) library, which is much more flexible and can draw data from various sources, such as a remote file or process environment, or from a key manager via [Castellan](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Castellan) interface, or from a secret vault. I think, the title for the talk was a bit misleading, as "plaintext" in that case was not in fact residing in configuration files but instead was retrieved from a secure store (obviously, stored as cyphertext and decrypted only upon retrieval).

After that I went to Embedded devroom to listen to a talk titled [WPE, The WebKit port for Embedded platforms](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ema_wpe/) about a well-maintained port of the WebKit engine, developed mainly by [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/). "Embedded platforms" in this case means those running Linux with glib, cairo, libsoup, gles-2.0 and [some other dependencies](https://elinux.org/images/9/9e/WPE_elc_prague_2017.pdf). WPEWebKit is, unlike many other ports, not tied to a specific widget set (like GTK+ or Qt) and is relatively configurable. It can use one of [3 different backends](https://github.com/Igalia/meta-webkit/wiki/WPE) for rendering and getting user input: the project's own FDO, [RDK](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Overview)-based one (with 3 different rendering suboptions: ``wayland``, ``rpi`` and ``imx6``) and one that uses mesa drivers and libgbm. It nicely integrates with Qt5/QML, providing a WebKit-based alternative to Qt's Blink-based [QtWebEngine](https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine) and possibility to use HTML5 parts rendered with that engine in QML projects. It also nicely integrates with GStreamer, providing a source component for video streams with zero-copy and accelerated decoding. The engine seems to be worthwhile to try in some real project, e.g., iMX6-based, although as is always the case with web-based UI, performance must be carefully evaluated.

After the talk I moved to building K, where LPI lottery was scheduled to happen soon. While waiting for it, I quietly sneaked into Containers and Security devroom to listen to conclusive part of "[Address Space Isolation in the Linux Kernel](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/kernel_address_space_isolation/)", promising myself that I'd watch the rest on [video](https://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.1.105/kernel_address_space_isolation.webm), when I get home.

Then I enjoyed a really interesting talk about trying automatedly to guess what a closed firmware blob does without violating legal provisions (at least, as applicable in Germany). The [AUTOREV framework](https://github.com/9elements/autorev) analyzes patched version of a firmware blob as a "black box" in virtualized environment (using [libx86emu](https://github.com/wfeldt/libx86emu), so only x86 is supported) and generates an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) and/or C code, that represents actions of the blob. The analysis is not very sophisticated (yet), so, e.g., loops or even reboots are not detected, but those limitations are recognized and scheduled to be removed by the project. A more fundamental limitation of the approach taken by the project is the necessity to run the blob many times in different circumstances (to see how it reacts to those), which "blows up" the time needed for analysis for a more or less serious firmware. That fact is also recognized by the developers. The framework seems to be a promising tool to analyze firmware behavior in specific situations on particular hardware.

After that talk, at 17:30 [Linux Professional Institute](https://www.lpi.org) organized a lottery, in which they drew numbered slips of paper submitted by participants, and chairman of the board [Jon "Maddog" Hall](https://twitter.com/maddoghall?lang=en) himself announced winners' numbers and gave out prizes (which he apparently sponsored and/or provided from his own stock, though I'm not sure of that). You could get penguins of different sizes, exclusive geek t-shirts from 70s, 80s and 90s, almost as exclusive books and vouchers for taking an LPI certification programme exam. The process was made more exciting by putting a drawn slip back into the same pool, so there was a chance for it to be drawn again. And indeed, there were people that had their number drawn 2, 3 or even 4 times. I was lucky to get one prize: a voucher valid for one exam with code between 010 and 702 until 1.07.2020. Then we took a [group photo](https://twitter.com/LPI_CE/status/1223657175257690113/photo/1) with Maddog, Penguin and our prizes.

Last [talk](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ema_lognplot/) of the day for me was in Embedded devroom about a high-performance logging and visualization software [lognplot](https://github.com/windelbouwman/lognplot), which included a live demonstration on an STM32 board with data streamed into connected PC for on-the-fly high-resolution examination in the application. The project includes:

- a library to receive (over a TCP socket), represent and quickly query timed measurements, and assist in charting and even rendering;
- two showcase applications (one in PyQt5 and one in Rust) to visualize and store measurements;
- demo programs to help integrate the library into different environments (currently, Simulink and C) via a glue rust-written static [libclognplot](https://github.com/windelbouwman/lognplot/blob/master/clognplot/src/client.rs) library with C-style API.

The performance shown in Rust application demo was really impressive: you could zoom in and out of a several million sample sized chart, seeing samples and their aggregate values, with several charts displayed simultaneously, without a visible lag in UI response.

## Sunday
First half of Sunday at FOSDEM went in [Hardware enablement](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/hardware_enablement/) devroom, where I listened to a series of very interesting talks. It started with [one](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/startup_gen/) about a free and open source tool to generate a board support package (understood here as linker script, [startup code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0) and low-level HW binding) out of a vendor-supplied ARM SoC [CMSIS-Pack](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Pack/html/index.html).

Then Anton Kuzmin [talked](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/fpga_hw_dbg/) about problems associated with commercial FPGA development tools (e.g., vendor/target lock) and open source alternatives available to design, model, synthesize and debug on-chip your FPGA blocks, along with _their_ problems and ways to avoid them. The talk included a live demonstration to prove the speaker's points.

In the next [talk](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/oshw_ci/) [Mario Behling](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/speaker/mario_behling/) was sharing his experience about continuous integration process in [Pocket Science Lab](https://pslab.io/) open hardware project. Yes, the CI in the talk concerns not _software_ but _hardware_ verification, upon each change or periodically. I had to take a small 30 min. break to catch the speaker by the sleeve and ask more questions in the corridor.

After a break I listened to [Drew Fustini](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/speaker/drew_fustini/) talking about the state of RISC-V ecosystem (architecture, variants, chips, boards, FPGA design tools, software toolchains and OS support) as well as open-source projects and associations that promote RISC-V usage. The [talk](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/riscv_fpga/), which could be better named "What it takes to run Linux on RISC-V", was very interesting and included a live demonstration of Linux booting on a [LiteX](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/riscv/litex_vexriscv/doc/litex_vexriscv.html)-based board with [VexRiscv](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv) soft CPU, _which was completely open-source_: aside from embedded software and its related set of tools (which is no surprize nowadays), the board's hardware, CPU specification, FPGA synthesis, place-and-route and programming tools were free and open-source!

After that presentation I went to [Internet of Things devroom](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/internet_of_things/) to listen to a talk which title sounded intriguing - "[IoT Updates with IPv6 Multicast](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/iotmulticast/)". The talk was about utilising multicast capabilities of IPv6 networks to solve scalability and reliability problem of delivering large blobs from a single server to many (0, 1, thousands, millions) clients. In spite of the problem's relevance to IoT world, I was surprized to see that: firstly, it has not yet been solved efficiently for many years; secondly, the speaker's [project](https://github.com/librestack/iotupd) aimed at solving it (or even claimed to have done that); and thirdly, the speaker's solution has not (yet?) gained adoption. I still had open questions about the approach presented, even after having asked the speaker some and having been answered.

After that I had my lunch and a stroll, to wait for the [keysigning party](https://fosdem.org/2020/keysigning/), where about 110 people checked each other's identities in real life, to decide whether to sign their PGP key later. I still have to do my homework on that...

Right after the party I rushed back into IoT devroom to hear about how [WolfSSL project](https://github.com/wolfSSL) was doing, as the presentation title "[WolfBoot. Secure boot and remote updates](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/iotwolfboot/)" hinted at a new component in the collection. I was expecting something related to EFI Secure Boot capable bootloader, not having read carefully the talk's annotation. Well, the [bootloader](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfBoot) is not related to EFI specification at all, but instead targets a very broad range of embedded systems, even bare-metal ones.

After another small break I went to enjoy the [closing talk](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/closing_fosdem/), this time preceded by a [celebration](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/fosdem_at_20/) one (since FOSDEM has been organized for the 20th time) and followed by a piece of cake for everybody and a group [FOSDEM t-shirt photo session](https://photos.app.goo.gl/c8G7nMdgjMn2sp8y6), in which I took part as well.

## Conclusion
As has been almost always with my trips to the conference, I have not been able to listen to all the talks I wanted to. Luckily, you can watch them afterwards, as all the [830+ talks](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/events/) (about 449 hours of content) have been live-streamed and [saved](https://video.fosdem.org/2020/) for later reference (see [this talk](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/videobox/) for an answer to an engineer's instant "how?" question). So, I'm still doing my homework while enjoying a vacation, just as I'm writing this report. The talks I missed there but planned to, or have watched already later, are:

- HW enablement devroom - "[FOSDEM Video Box. A bespoke HDMI capture device for conferences](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/videobox/)";
- IoT devroom - "[Sphactor: actor model concurrency for creatives](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/iotsphactor/)";
- Microkernels devroom - "[The HIPPEROS RTOS. A Song of Research and Development](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/uk_hipperos/)";
- Microkernels devroom - "[Linux Kernel Library. A Library Version of Linux Kernel](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/uk_linux/)";
- OSFW devroom - "[Discover UEFI with U-Boot](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/firmware_duwu/)";
- OSFW devroom - "[Look at ME! Intel ME firmware investigation](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/firmware_lam/)";
- IoT devroom - "[Using Micropython to develop an IoT sensor platform with an Augmented Reality UI. How to marry the physical world and IoT with the virtual](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/iotmicropython/)".

I'd like to express my gratitude to my employer, [Etteplan Software and Embedded Solutions](https://www.etteplan.com/services/embedded-systems), for financial support for this trip.
